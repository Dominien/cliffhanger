🔍 Feedback & Redesign Suggestions for This Section
Your current section is clean but lacks visual impact, hierarchy, and interactivity. Here’s how to enhance it based on modern UI/UX principles:

🚀 What Needs Improvement?
Lack of Visual Hierarchy

The headline is strong, but it could pop more with better spacing and a stronger contrast to separate it from the subtext.
The bullet points blend too much into the background – they don’t feel dynamic or engaging.
The CTA button feels disconnected, making it less compelling.
Weak Right-Side Visual Representation

The wireframe-style mockup is too abstract – it lacks detail, making it feel generic and lifeless.
The blue button in the mockup feels randomly placed and doesn’t contribute much to the storytelling.
There’s no visual indication of customization or AI-driven elements.
Minimal Engagement & Depth

The section feels static – no depth, no interactivity, no focal point.
The spacing between elements is too uniform, making it feel flat rather than structured.
🎨 Redesign Suggestions Based on Design Guidelines
1️⃣ Improve Visual Hierarchy
Make the Headline More Prominent

Increase font size slightly (without overpowering the layout).
Add a subtle gradient or shadow to make it pop.
Consider a short supporting line under it in a smaller font to reinforce trust.
Enhance Bullet Points

Instead of flat blue checkmarks, use modern outlined icons with a soft background shape to create contrast.
Use bold text for key phrases to help with scanability (e.g., "100% an dein Business angepasst").
Consider turning the bullet list into a structured 3-column layout (on large screens) to break the monotonous vertical flow.
2️⃣ Make the Right-Side Visual Engaging
✅ Ditch the abstract wireframe → Replace it with one of these:

A realistic browser mockup with more detail & soft shadows.
A layered UI preview showing elements moving or being customized.
An AI-assisted wireframe being refined in real time (to emphasize the AI-driven process).
✅ Animate Some Elements

Subtle hover or fade-in animations to make it feel interactive.
A simple progress bar or timeline effect showing the "before" and "after" of the landing page transformation.
✅ Add Personalization Hints

Maybe show an editable field in the UI preview, indicating how easily changes can be made.
A small AI-chip icon or a "smarter insights" label could reinforce the AI-driven assistance.
3️⃣ Revamp the CTA Placement & Style
Button Needs More Emphasis

Make it bigger & bolder (but still in brand colors).
Add a subtle hover effect – slight color shift or glow to create engagement.
Move it slightly up, so it visually connects to the bullet points instead of floating separately.
Supporting Microcopy Below CTA

Add a short line of reassurance under the CTA, e.g.,
🏆 „Keine Verpflichtung – teste dein Design risikofrei“
🔄 Suggested Structure After Redesign
✅ Left Side (Text & CTA)

More dominant headline with better spacing
Three structured bullet points with icons
Stronger CTA with microcopy underneath
✅ Right Side (Visual)

More detailed UI preview with branding
AI-driven element incorporated (e.g., "smarter suggestions" bubble)
Smoother hierarchy & interaction (soft shadow, transitions, depth)
🚀 Summary:
More structure & depth → Right now, it’s too "flat".
Stronger visual storytelling → Show AI-driven customization in action.
Better CTA placement → Move it up, add hover effects.
More interactive elements → Subtle animations for modern, high-tech feel.
